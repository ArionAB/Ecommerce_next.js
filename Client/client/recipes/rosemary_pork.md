## **Hot Honey-Rosemary Pork Loin**

(slightly spicy rosemary-infused honey roasted pork)
Serves 4

### **What you need:**

1 (1½ pound) pork loin
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
¼ cup **[Multiflower Honey](http://localhost:3000/miere/08db258d-1724-45be-8a38-9ad92e2e29aa)** or your favorite Savannah Bee Company Honey

¼ cup whole-grain Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
1½ tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, plus more for garnish
Savannah Bee Company® Hot Honey, for garnish

### **What to do:**

1. **Prep the Dish:** Preheat oven to broil. Spread the Chocolate Whipped Honey across the bottom of a 10.5-inch to 12-inch cast iron pan. Cover the top with a single layer of marshmallows (you may have a few left over).

2. **Toast the Marshmallows:** Place the skillet in the preheated oven on the middle rack and toast until golden brown on top (about 1-3 minutes) Pro Tip: Do not use the top rack of the oven as you don't want your marshmallows to burn.

3. **Make the sauce:** Stir together the honey, mustard, vinegar, and rosemary. Set aside and reserve half of the mixture. Pour the remaining mixture over the pork and brush to coat all sides.

4. **Bake the pork:** Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the pork registers 145° F when tested with a meat thermometer.

### **To Serve:**

Drizzle the pork with the reserved sauce and garnish with more rosemary and hot honey, if desired.
