_An ooey gooey chocolatey quick dessert that takes no time to make and less time to eat...because it's that delicious!_

## **S'mores Skillet Dessert**

(chocolate whipped honey, scorched marshmallows + graham cracker dippers)
Serves 2-6

### **What you need:**

1 (12oz) jar Savannah Bee Company Whipped Honey with Chocolate (yes, it's the whole jar, don't skimp...your people are worth it)
1 (10oz) bag large marshmallows or make your own Honey Marshmallows!
Graham Crackers for dipping

### **What to do:**

1. **Wash Up!**

2. **Prep the Dish:** Preheat oven to broil. Spread the Chocolate Whipped Honey across the bottom of a 10.5-inch to 12-inch cast iron pan. Cover the top with a single layer of marshmallows (you may have a few left over).

3. **Toast the Marshmallows:** Place the skillet in the preheated oven on the middle rack and toast until golden brown on top (about 1-3 minutes) Pro Tip: Do not use the top rack of the oven as you don't want your marshmallows to burn.

### **To Serve:**

Serve immediately with graham crackers for dipping!
