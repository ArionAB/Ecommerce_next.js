## **Cajun Honey Catfish**

(skillet blackened catfish + honey pan sauce)
Serves 4

### **What you need:**cd c

1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 small (or 2 large) catfish fillets (1½ to 2 pounds)
¼ cup butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
¼ cup **[Multiflower Honey](http://localhost:3000/miere/08db258d-1724-45be-8a38-9ad92e2e29aa)**
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Chopped fresh parsley and lemon wedges for garnish (optional)

### **What to do:**

1. **Dredge the catfish** Stir together the paprika, garlic powder, thyme, parsley, oregano, salt, and cayenne pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge the catfish in the seasoning mixture, pressing to coat evenly.

2. **Cook the catfish:** Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the catfish and cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until it flakes easily with a fork. Remove the fish from the skillet and keep warm.

3. **Make the pan sauce:** Add the remaining butter to the skillet until melted. Stir in the honey, brown sugar, and lemon juice. Cook 1 minute or until the sauce is simmering.

4. **Bake the pork:** Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the pork registers 145° F when tested with a meat thermometer.

### **To Serve:**

Pour the sauce over the catfish and sprinkle with parsley and a squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately.

### **Pro Tip:**

We love this dish served from the skillet on the table alongside a dish of hot red rice.
