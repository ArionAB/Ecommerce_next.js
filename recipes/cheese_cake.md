## **Holiday Honey Cheesecake Tart**

(creamy honey-sweetened cheesecake + honey ginger snap crust)
Makes 1 (9-inch) Tart

### **What you need:**

### **Cust:**

3 tablespoons butter, melted (plus more for buttering tart pan)
18 to 20 ginger snap cookies
1/4 cup **[Multiflower Honey](http://localhost:3000/miere/08db258d-1724-45be-8a38-9ad92e2e29aa)**
1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt

### **Cheesecake:**

1 pound (16oz) cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup **[Multiflower Honey](http://localhost:3000/miere/08db258d-1724-45be-8a38-9ad92e2e29aa)**
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt
2 eggs, lightly whisked
1/3 cup plain whole yogurt
Sugared cranberries and rosemary sprigs for garnish

### **What to do:**

1. **Prepare the crust:** Preheat the oven to 375° F. Butter the inside of a 9-inch tart pan. Cover the outside of the tart pan in tin foil (making sure to leave no cracks for water to sneak in during the baking process). Add ginger snaps to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until crumbs are fine (you should have 1 ½ cups cookie crumbs). Add melted butter, honey and salt. Pulse until combined. Press the crumb mixture firmly into the tart pan allowing for a thicker sidewall. Bake the crust for until set (about 12-15 minutes). Allow to cool.

2. **Prepare the filling:** Preheat the oven to 300° F. Set about 4-6 cups of water to boil. Using a standing mixer, beat cream cheese until fluffy and smooth on medium speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle before adding honey slowly. Beat until fluffy. Add zest, juice and salt. Beat in the eggs, scrape down the sides and beat in yogurt. Allow to beat for a minute until fluffy.
3. **Cook the cheesecake:** Place the foil-wrapped and cooled crust in a deep-sided sheet pan or roasting pan. Pour in the filling slowly, until the cheesecake is nearly domed in the pan, but not covering the top of the crust. (There may be a small amount of extra filling, depending on how fluffy your filling is.) Pour boiling water into the pan halfway up the side of the tart pan. Bake until just set for 30-45 minutes. Cool and chill overnight. Decorate the top of the tart with sugared cranberries and rosemary sprigs for a little holiday flare. We also love this decorated with clementine slices.

### **Pro Tip:**

-Cover the tart pan in foil for the water bath before you add the crust!
-Brown the butter for your crust, we always do.
-Cut the cheesecake with a knife warmed under hot water for clean cuts

### **To Sugar the cranberries for garnish:**

Use one egg white and roll desired number of cranberries in the egg whites; remove and toss in a small bowl of sanding sugar (very finely ground sugar)-we used pink! Place on a paper towel to dry for at least 1 hour. Handle carefully!
