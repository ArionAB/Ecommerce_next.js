## **Hot Honey Glazed Bacon**

(crispy thick cut bacon + spicy kick)
Serves 4-6

### **What you need:**

12 slices smoked thick-cut bacon
1/3 cup **[Multiflower Honey](http://localhost:3000/miere/08db258d-1724-45be-8a38-9ad92e2e29aa)**

### **What to do:**

1. **Prep the Dish:** Preheat oven to 400º F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Toast the Marshmallows:** Place bacon on a prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Cook until beginning to render fat (about 10 minutes).
3. **Make the sauce:** While bacon is cooking, add the hot honey to a small saucepan over low heat and cook just until heated through and a thinner consistency.

4. **Bake the pork:** Remove bacon from the oven and brush the strips liberally with the hot honey. Return to the oven and roast until crispy and deeply caramelized (about 10-15 minutes). The bacon will crisp as it cools. For extra honey heat, turn the strips halfway through the roasting process, and brush the other side with the hot honey.

### **Pro Tip:**

For an extra pop of heat, sprinkle bacon with ¼ teaspoon of coarsely ground black pepper as it is cooling.
